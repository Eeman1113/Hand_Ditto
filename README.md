]

if __name__ == '__main__':
    hand = Hand()

    # Customize your handwriting
    biases = [.75 for i in lines]
    styles = [9 for i in lines]
    stroke_colors = ['red', 'green', 'black', 'blue']
    stroke_widths = [1, 2, 1, 2]

    hand.write(
        filename='img/usage_demo.svg',
        lines=lines,
        biases=biases,
        styles=styles,
        stroke_colors=stroke_colors,
        stroke_widths=stroke_widths
    )
```

### Song Lyrics Demos

Enjoy some classic lyrics beautifully handwritten:

1. **All Star** by Smash Mouth

    biases = [.75 for i in lines]
    styles = [12 for i in lines]

    hand.write(
        filename='img/all_star.svg',
        lines=lines,
        biases=biases,
        styles=styles,
    )
    ```

2. **A Thousand Miles** by Vanessa Carlton
    ```python
    lines = downtown.split("\n")
    biases = [.75 for i in lines]
    styles = np.cumsum(np.array([len(i) for i in lines]) == 0).astype(int)

    hand.write(
        filename='img/downtown.svg',
        lines=lines,
        biases=biases,
        styles=styles,
    )
    ```

3. **Never Gonna Give You Up** by Rick Astley
    ```python
    lines = give_up.split("\n")
    biases = .2 * np.flip(np.cumsum([len(i) == 0 for i in lines]), 0)
    styles = [7 for i in lines]

    hand.write(
        filename='img/give_up.svg',
        lines=lines,
